## Introduction

Code samples and information for my talk "Quickly Testing Legacy Code" at [C++ on Sea 2019](https://cpponsea.uk/).

The samples here demonstrate use of [ApprovalTests.cpp](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp), which is a new C++ implementation of Llewellyn Falco's [Approval Tests](http://approvaltests.com/) approach to testing legacy code.
